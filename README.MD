## How to use:
1. After generate and run container, use this Makefile command
```bash
$ make sh
```

2. The terminal shell will open. In this shell, the following commands will be invoked:
```bash
$ python app.py --page_target {1,2} --optional-arguments
```

| Argument      | Mandatory       | Values to select | Describe                       |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------   | ------------------------------ |
| --page_target | Yes             | 1, 2             | Run the crawler in page target | 
| --print       |                 |                  | Show results on the screen     |
| --save_csv    |                 |                  | Save data in CSV file          |
| --save_json   |                 |                  | Save data in JSON file         |

For only show on the screen the informations crawled from page target 1
```bash
$ python app.py --page_target 1 --print
```

For show on the screen and save in json file the informations crawled from page target 1
```bash
$ python app.py --page_target 1 --print --save_json
```

For only save in csv file the informations crawled from page target 1
```bash
$ python app.py --page_target 1 --save_csv
```

## FAQ

- **Why couldn't I build the container?**
    
    When executing the make build command, the following error may occur:
    ```bash
    $ Compile failed: command '/usr/bin/gcc' failed with exit code 1
    $ cc -I/usr/include/libxml2 -I/usr/include/libxml2 -c /tmp/xmlXPathInithz_zt2o6.c -o tmp/xmlXPathInithz_zt2o6.o cc tmp/xmlXPathInithz_zt2o6.o -lxml2 -o a.out error: command '/usr/bin/gcc' failed with exit code 1
    ```
    This error occurs because in the configuration of Docker resources the memory is configured by default with 2.00GB. To build this container it is necessary to change it to at least 3.00GB.
